# Digital Business Card

This project is a digital reimagination of a business card, built using HTML and CSS. It was inspired by a challenge from the Scrimba platform.

## Key Learnings:

**Font Fallbacks**: It's important to incorporate fallback fonts to ensure consistent display even if specific fonts are unavailable.

**Block-Level div**: Div elements behave as block-level elements by default, occupying the full width of their container.

**CSS Box Model**: The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of content, padding, borders and margins. 

**:root Pseudo-Class**: Matches the root element of a tree representing the document.

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**
